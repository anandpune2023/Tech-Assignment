# Google Integration Portal 🚀

## Overview

This project is a centralized platform for users to view and manage their Google My Business reviews. It leverages (or simulates) the Google My Business API to fetch and display reviews, allowing users to respond directly from the portal. 

## Key Features ✨

* **Google Authentication:** Secure user access (currently mocked). 🔐
* **Google Reviews:** Fetch and display reviews, enable user replies. 💬
* **Responsive Design:** Works across various devices. 📱💻

## Technical Implementation 🛠️

* **Backend:** Python with Flask
* **Frontend:** (To be implemented) - React, Node.js, or similar
* **APIs:** Google My Business API (simulated for now)
* **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (mocked)

## Setup and Configuration ⚙️

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.12
   * Flask
   * JavaScript
   * React
   * Node.js

2. **Installation:**
   
   * pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Running the Application:**

 

   * python app.py


   * The backend will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

4. **API Endpoints:**

   * GET /api/reviews: Fetches reviews (requires authentication)
   * POST /api/reviews/<review_id>/reply: Adds a reply (requires authentication)
     
## Frontend Integration (TODO) 🚧
   * Handle user authentication
   * Display reviews
   * Allow user replies
   * Provide an intuitive UI

## Challenges and Future Enhancements 🚀
   * Integrate the actual Google My Business API and OAuth 2.0

   * Implement robust error handling

   * Integrate a database for user data, tokens, and caching

## Add features:

   * Filtering/sorting reviews
   * More advanced API interactions
   * Analytics and reporting
     
## Dummy API Implementation 🎭
   * Currently uses DUMMY_DATA to simulate the API
   * authentication is mocked to always return True
   * Expected API Response Structure (for future reference) ➡️
JSON
{
  "reviewId": "...",
  "reviewer": {
    "displayName": "...",
    "profilePhotoUrl": "..."
  },
  "comment": "...",
  "starRating": ...,
  "createTime": "...",
  "response": .....
}
